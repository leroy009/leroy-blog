## Bun vs Node — Which to Choose?

Both are JavaScript runtimes but have different focuses.

### Performance

- Bun: faster startup and JS execution in many benchmarks.
- Node: mature optimizations, stable for production workloads.

### Ecosystem & Compatibility

- Node: huge ecosystem, full compatibility with most npm packages.
- Bun: rapidly improving, may have compatibility gaps for some native modules.

### Tooling

- Bun includes package manager, bundler, and test runner.
- Node relies on separate tools (npm/yarn, webpack/esbuild, Jest).

### Recommendation

- Use Bun for fast local development and smaller services.
- Use Node when you need maximum ecosystem compatibility and stability.
