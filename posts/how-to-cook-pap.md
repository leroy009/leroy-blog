<!-- # How to Cook Pap -->

Pap is a traditional porridge made from maize meal, commonly enjoyed in many African countries. Here's a simple guide to cook pap:

## Ingredients

-   2 cups of maize meal (cornmeal)
-   4 cups of water
-   A pinch of salt (optional)

## Instructions

1. **Boil Water**  
   Pour 3 cups of water into a pot and bring it to a boil.

2. **Mix Maize Meal**  
   In a separate bowl, mix 1 cup of maize meal with 1 cup of cold water to form a smooth paste.

3. **Combine**  
   Gradually add the maize meal paste into the boiling water while stirring continuously to avoid lumps.

4. **Cook**  
   Reduce the heat to low and cover the pot. Let the pap cook for 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent it from sticking to the pot.

5. **Thicken**  
   Add the remaining maize meal gradually while stirring until the pap reaches your desired thickness.

6. **Simmer**  
   Cover the pot and let the pap simmer on low heat for another 10-15 minutes. Stir occasionally.

7. **Serve**  
   Once cooked, serve hot with your favorite stew, vegetables, or relish.

Enjoy your delicious pap!
