## How to Cook Perfect Rice

Use the absorption method for white rice.

### Ratio & Steps

- Ratio: 1 cup rice to 1.5–2 cups water depending on rice type.

1. Rinse rice until water runs clear.
2. Bring water to a boil, add rice and a pinch of salt.
3. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 15–20 minutes.
4. Remove from heat and let sit covered for 5–10 minutes.

### Tips

- Use a fork to fluff before serving.
- Brown rice needs longer cooking time and more water.
