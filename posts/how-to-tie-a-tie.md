## How to Tie a Tie — The Four-in-Hand Knot

The Four-in-Hand is a versatile, easy knot that works for most collars.

### Steps

1. Drape the tie with the wide end on your right, about 12 inches lower than the narrow end.
2. Cross the wide end over the narrow end.
3. Wrap the wide end behind the narrow end once.
4. Bring the wide end across the front and up through the loop around your neck.
5. Pull the wide end down through the front loop and tighten by holding the knot and sliding it up.

### Tips

- Keep the tie snug but comfortable.
- The tip of the wide end should reach your belt buckle.

Enjoy a neat, classic knot suitable for most occasions.
