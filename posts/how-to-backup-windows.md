## How to Backup Your Windows PC

Use File History for files and System Image for full backups.

### Files

1. Open Settings → Update & Security → Backup.
2. Set up File History to back up to an external drive.

### Full System Image

- Use the built-in "Backup and Restore (Windows 7)" to create a system image.

### Tips

- Keep at least one offsite or cloud backup.
- Test restore occasionally.
